This code intends to facilitate the design and analysis of structures/metamaterials

The main code is called "STEP1_F3DAS.m".
This code includes inputs that should be changed by the user.
The user typically needs to change the "generate_mesh.m" file as well,
to create the parametric geometries of the structure/metamaterial.
The code is commented and most of it should be self-explanatory. However,
sometimes it may be useful to run the code in two separate phases
(e.g. if using a computer cluster).
